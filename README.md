# Monte-carlo-integration-and-pi-estimation
 In this script I implemented an estimate of pi using the Monte Carlo method, I also implemented 3 other functions that integrate functions, one using the Monte Carlo method, another using a normal Riemann integral, and finally an integration of a function of two variables using the Monte Carlo method.

Note: This script has a problem, it does not deal with singularities in the function, that is, if the integrated function has an indeterminacy in the integration range, the integration will not work.

The main reason behind this implementation was to better understand the Monte Carlo method.
