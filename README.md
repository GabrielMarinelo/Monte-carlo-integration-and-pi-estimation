# Monte-carlo-integration-and-pi-estimation
 In this script I implemented an estimate of pi using the Monte Carlo method, I also implemented 3 other functions that integrate functions, one using the Monte Carlo method, another using a normal Riemann integral, and finally an integration of a function of two variables using the Monte Carlo method.
